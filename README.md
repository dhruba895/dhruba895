About Me

I am a Senior VMware Solution Engineer in the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). I focus on Automation, Integration and Operation for the VMware Cloud based Software Defined Datacenters (SDDC). One of my primary responsibility is driving VMware Cloud's (VMC) Customer[0] initiative and helping provide early feedback on the usability, design and support architecture of new VMC features and capabilities. I work closely with Engineering & Product Management on developing new ideas and integrations to VMC which extend into our on-premises customers. Lastly, through customer interactions I continue champion their challenges and needs to help further improve VMwareâ€™s products and services. I am also working in carbon balck for security.
